# My-projects
# The file Code.ipynb is about the study and development of technologies, algorithms, and the use
# of Artificial Neural Networks for metamodeling in the metal forming field. 
# in the file Vers3.ipynb the aim of the work was to build such a system that will give accurate image of possible defects and problems that can arise during manufacturing process. Which will be creating a semi-factorial experimental design (DoE)
